      <h2>Holaaa. My name is Abil Khairi.</h2>

      <h3>
        I was born in North Aceh on September 7, 2002, Indonesia.
        <br />
        Now I am a 5th semesters student at Malikussaleh University. I also
        participated in the Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka , where I took the
        Independent Study program with the Frontend Developer learning path.
        <br />
        <br />
        I once completed a python bootcamp organized by Syahkuala University.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I was in high school, I had 1 year experience in youth scientific
        work organizations as vice chairman, and also won 1st place in the FLS2N
        short video competition in North Aceh Regency.
        <br />
        <br />
        Some of the skills I have are Photography, Videography, Art Vector,
        Design Poster and UI UX Design.
        <br />
        <br />
        My spesific emphasis and passion is in the art of Web Development, but i
        truly find all aspects of this medium, from art to design, to be
        incredibly inspiring and moving.
        <br />
        <br />I like to find inspiration about art, be it poster design or
        website UI. I don't know why I really like designing, it's like there's
        satisfaction in making a display with my own imagination.
